# Project 4 - Team Holbrook Working


## Topic
In this project, we are exploring whether families with children (under 13 years old) meet nutritional requirements, and the nuances within this sufficiency or lack thereof (e.g. how does this vary between the rural and urban areas, number of children?) What policies can be implemented to assist families in meeting their nutritional requirements more effectively?

## Goals
- Develop a demand and nutrient system to estimate demands and nutrients for different types of food as a function of prices, budgets, and household characteristics.
- Identify the biggest nutritional challenges for families with children under 13 years old and develop a policy goal to address these challenges.
- Design and simulate two or more policies to achieve the policy goal and assess their costs.
- Conduct a holistic analysis of population, health, nutrition, economy, and climate trends in Tanzania from 2008-2014 and develop a demand model to analyze food demand.
- Assess the long-term impacts of nutritional intake and food demand changes in Tanzania, considering future projections such as GDP growth, climate change, and agricultural changes.
